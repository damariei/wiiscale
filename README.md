### The WiiScale App

#### Description
WiiScale is a little Mac app (OS X 10.6+) that connects to your Wii Balance Board over Bluetooth and records your weight. This is a lot quicker then using something like the WiiFit game in which many steps are involved to do a simple weigh-in.


#### Project Goals
- Allow quick and easy weigh-ins
- Save data to a searchable database
- Allow different user profiles


#### Future Goals
- Connect to different online services
- Set user goals and enable easy tracking
